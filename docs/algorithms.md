# Generation Algorithms

TerrainGen uses various algorithms to generate terrain heightmaps. Here's an overview of the currently implemented methods.

## Flat Terrain

The flat terrain generator creates a uniform heightmap where all points have the same elevation. While not particularly interesting for terrain generation, it serves several purposes:

- Testing and validation of the generation pipeline
- Creating base terrains for further modification
- As a control case when comparing different generation methods

## Perlin Noise

Perlin noise is one of the most widely-used methods for generating terrain. This algorithm, developed by Ken Perlin in 1983, creates smooth, continuous pseudo-random variations that can closely resemble natural terrain features.

### How Perlin Noise Works

Perlin noise works by:
1. Generating a grid of random gradient vectors
2. Computing interpolated values between these vectors
3. (Not yet implemented in TerrainGen) Combining multiple frequencies (octaves) of noise to create natural-looking variation

### Characteristics

- **Continuity**: The generated terrain is smooth and continuous, without sudden jumps in elevation
- **Reproducibility**: Using the same seed will always generate the same terrain
- **Natural Appearance**: The resulting heightmaps resemble natural terrain features like hills and valleys

### Parameters

The Perlin noise generator accepts a seed value that determines the random number sequence used to generate the terrain. Using the same seed will produce identical results, making it useful for:

- Debugging and testing
- Generating consistent terrain across different runs
- Sharing specific terrain configurations with others

## Future Developments

Additional terrain generation techniques are planned for future releases, including

- Diamond-Square algorithm
- Erosion simulation
